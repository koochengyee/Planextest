My Random Website
I decided to go with a one-page website that looks professional yet requires minimal time and effort to update. After searching and trying out a few different templates, I settled on ayro ui business template that fits all the requirements. The code is clean, the page loading speed is excellent, easily maintainable, and passed all SEO checkups. Here are the changes I made:

Features
- Tested the responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Replace most stock images with compressed images except the logo.
- Remove unnecessary coding to reduce bloating.
- Ensure all requirements are met (smooth scrolling, header, hero section, product, testimonials, contact form, footer, form validation)
- Ensure proper tagging and all images has alt text.
- Will include schema and GA when requested.
